# A simple weather app

This is a weather app created with React. It uses two public APIs to get the location and the weather for the user: https://geocode.xyz and https://goweather.herokuapp.com

Although the weather API mentioned above is amazing — because it is free — it does not always give the most accurate data. Nevertheless, it was a very nice practice project for me given that I created it completely from scratch and got to practice async/await and fetch as well as creating apps with React!


## Current version

You can take a look at the current version of the app at https://my-amazing-weather.netlify.app/
The Geocode.xyz API has a very hard limit on requests per second, and I am using the free version, so it may take a few clicks on the "Try Again" button before the data loads up.
